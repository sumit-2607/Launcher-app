Lawnchair is a free, open-source home app for Android. Taking Launcher3—Android’s default home app—as a starting point, it ports Pixel Launcher features and introduces rich customization options.

This branch houses the codebase of Lawnchair 15, which is currently in beta and is based on Launcher3 from Android 15. For Lawnchair 9 to 14, see the branches with the `9-` to `14-` prefixes, respectively.

## Features

-   **Material You Theming:** Adapts to your wallpaper and system theme.
-   **At a Glance Widget:** Displays information *at a glance* with support for [Smartspacer](https://github.com/KieronQuinn/Smartspacer).
-   **QuickSwitch Support:** Integrates with Android Recents on Android 10 and newer. (requires root)
-   **Global Search:** Allows quick access to apps, contacts, and web results from the home screen.
-   **Customization Options:** Provides options to tweak icons, fonts, and colors to your liking.
-   And more!
