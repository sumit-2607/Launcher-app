Lawnchair is a free, open-source home app for Android. Taking Launcher3—Android’s default home app—as a starting point, it ports Pixel Launcher features and introduces rich customization options.

This branch houses the codebase of Lawnchair 15, which is currently in development and is based on Launcher3 from Android 15. For Lawnchair 9 to 14, see the branches with the `9-` to `14-` prefixes, respectively.
